% Relevant class options:
%
% oneside:
% For shorter thesis like seminar papers you can use the single-sided layout, for longer thesis
% the double-sided layout is preferred (and it uses less paper, too). If you would like to have
% a single-sided print, use the 'oneside' option in the documentclass.
%
% BCOR=<value>:
% Depending on your method of binding, you might want to change the BCOR setting to account for
% the part of the pages that are hidden in the cover (e.g., set 'BCOR=10mm' if 1cm is hidden). 
%
% german:
% The standard behavior of this template is to produce English documents. If you would like to
% write your work in German, just include the 'german' option.
%
% draft:
% If you set the 'draft' option, overfull boxes will be highlighted in the PDF file so that you can
% find them more easily.
\documentclass[oneside]{pi4-thesis}

% The title page in this template has a pretty standard layout. While all relevant information are
% displayed on it, it surely could be improved to look nicer. You are invited to change the title
% page to your needs. If you have found a pleasing layout, I will be glad if you share it with me.

% Fill in the relevant information in the following lines.

\abstractchap
Information Visualization is widely used to support data analysis. Especially, interactive visual data exploration supports the analyst in gaining insights from the data. Also companies discovered the value of visual data exploration for improving their business by understanding their data. Some examples are understanding customers, predicting machine maintenance or forecasting the business development. Even though industries collect different kinds of data business data usually share the commonality of time-linkage - the so called time-oriented data. Time-oriented data is challenging as this data type is usually of high volume which causes similar problems as Big Data. The visualization of Big Data is problematic because visual clutter, information and orientation loss appear. These problems complicate visual data analysis. 
\par
In literature exist various clutter reduction techniques such as aggregation or multi-resolution. Different visualization techniques scale better and reduce visual clutter. In the context of time-oriented data this thesis analyzes multivariate time-oriented visualization techniques and determines their scalability. As scalable visualization techniques alone are not sufficient data reduction methods and interaction techniques are reviewed to reduce Big Data challenges in visualization. After the analysis of data reduction techniques a criteria catalogue is suggested for displaying large scale data effectively. 
\par
This schema is applied to current visualization tools and frameworks used in business. Data companies make use of visualization tools and frameworks to visually explore their data. They expect to have a tool with many features or an easy-to-use tool. Often, they expect both completeness and ease-of-use.  In order to answer the question of feature support three tools and one framework have been studied with respect to completeness and ease-of-use.
