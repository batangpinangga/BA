abstract = {Visual scalability is the capability of visualization tools effectively to display large datasets, in terms of either the number or the dimension of individual data elements. This article defines and structures the problem of visual scalability, with special emphasis on the role of visualization as a means of access to details of the data. This is done abstractly in terms of responses that measure the business or scientific impact of visualizations and factors that affect the responses, and concretely in terms of measures of visual scalability and factors inuencing them. We assess both current capabilities and future prospects along a number of dimensions. Our approach for increasing visual scalability includes improved visual metaphors, interactivity and perspectives that link multiple views.},

abstract = {An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called 'recursive pattern' which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data-and application-dependent parameters, the user may largely influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only lim-ited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the ba-sic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide sev-eral examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimen-sion (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.},

abstract = {In today's applications data is produced at unprece-dented rates. While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data vol-umes increases at much lower pace. This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information " concealed " in the data. The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heteroge-nous, and dynamic volumes of information through integra-tion of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Further-more, it is the combination of related research areas includ-ing visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns vi-sual analytics into a promising field of research. This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, and details the most important technical re-search challenges in the field.},

abstract = {Business Information Visualization is a relatively new field and has just started to gain researchers' and practitioners' attention. Similar to Scientific Visualization and Information Visualization, it is intended to consider human cognition and perception characteristics and provide insight into data by computer generated visual representations. However, owing to the nature of business data, Business Information Visualization faces special challenges such as dealing with non-geometric data and incorporating human problem-solving processes. In research and practice, there is a need to understand the specific challenges of visualizing business data and the procedures of how to do it. This paper gives a brief overview of the history and development of Business Information Visualization. It then presents a methodology for developing business information visualization systems to enhance human problem solving and decision-making. This methodology includes one proposition, three technical challenges, and four stages in a visualization model. The author then presented a visualization system where this methodology is applied. Finally, the author discusses several issues that researchers and practitioners need to face.},

In this paper, we outline the scope of Visual Analytics using two problem and three methodological classes in order to work out the need for and purpose of Visual Analytics. Thereby, the respective advantages and disadvantages of automated and visual analysis methods are explained plus examples of analytic reasoning interaction leading to a glimpse into the future of how Visual Analytics methods will enable us to go beyond what is possible when separately using the two methods.},

abstract = {It is already true that Big Data has drawn huge attention from researchers in information sciences, policy and decision makers in governments and enterprises. As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore's Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

There is a large number of information visualization techniques which have been developed over the last decade to support the exploration of large data sets. In this paper, we propose a classification of information visu-alization and visual data mining techniques which is based on the data type to be visualized, the visualization technique and the interaction and distortion technique.

abstract = {Visual data analysis of time related data sets has attracted much research interest recently, and a number of sophis-ticated visualization methods have been proposed in the past. In financial analysis, however, the most important and most common visualization techniques for time series data is the traditional line-or bar chart. Although these are intuitive and make it easy to spot the effect of key events on a asset's price, and its return over a given period of time, price charts do not allow the easy perception of relative movements in terms of growth rates, which is the key feature of any price-related time series. This paper presents a novel Growth Matrix visualization technique for analyzing assets. It extends the ability of existing chart techniques by not only visualizing asset return rates over fixed time frames, but over the full spectrum of all subintervals present in a given time frame, in a single view. At the same time, the technique allows a comparison of subinterval return rates among groups of even a few hundreds of assets. This provides a powerful way for analyzing financial data, since it allows the identification of strong and weak periods of assets as compared to global market characteristics, and thus allows a more encompassing visual classification into " good " and " poor" performers than existing chart techniques. We illustrate the technique by real-world examples showing the abilities of the new approach, and its high relevance for financial analysis tasks.},

While there are extensive visualization techniques for exploring serial data, and a few for exploring periodic data, no existing technique simultaneously displays serial and periodic attributes of a data set. We introduce a spiral visualization technique, which displays data along a spiral to highlight serial attributes along the spiral axis and periodic ones along the radii. We show several applications of the spiral visualization to data exploration tasks, present our implementation, discuss the capacity for data analysis, and present findings of our informal study with users in data-rich scientific domains.},

abstract = {THE AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED AND WAREHOUSED IN ALL INDUSTRIES IS GROWING AT a phenomenal rate. From the financial sector to telecommunications operations, companies increasingly rely on analysis of huge amounts of data to compete. Although ad hoc mixtures of statistical techniques and file management tools once sufficed for digging through mounds of corporate data, the size of modern data warehouses, the mission-critical nature of the data, and the speed with which analyses need to be made now call for a new approach. A new generation of techniques and tools is emerging to intelligently assist humans in analyzing mountains of data and finding critical nuggets of useful knowledge, and in some cases to perform analyses automatically. These techniques and tools are the subject of the growing field of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) [5]. KDD is an umbrella term describing a variety of activities for making sense of data. We use the term to describe the overall process of finding useful patterns in data, including not only the data mining step of running specific discovery algorithms but also pre- and postprocessing and a host of other important activities. Our goal here is to provide a brief overview of the key issues in knowledge discovery in an industrial context and outline representative applications},

However, how people perceive and interact with a visualization tool can strongly influence their understanding of the data as well as the system's usefulness. Human factors therefore contribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an important role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools. Several research initiatives have begun to explore human factors in visualization, particularly in perception-based design. Nonetheless, visualization work involving human factors is in its infancy, and many potentially promising areas have yet to be explored. Therefore, this paper aims to 1) review known methodology for doing human factors research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors research in visualization to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future research.},

abstract = {We visualize data for various purposes. Specific purposes direct us to select and design visualizations in particular ways and to rely on software tools that support particular features (visualizations, interactions, defaults, etc.). For instance, a product that works well for developing performance monitoring dashboards might not support exploratory data analysis at all, because the user interface and functionality that are required to support these two purposes differ in several significant respects. When you evaluate the merits of a data visualization product, you should do so in light of the purposes for which it will be used. Today, no single data visualization product will support all purposes equally well. In this article, I am proposing criteria for evaluating visualization products that will be used primarily for one purpose in particular: exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA involves two related activities: 1) exploration, to find facts of potential interest in a data set, and 2) sensemaking (a.k.a., data analysis or descriptive statistics), to determine what the facts mean. Other purposes for which data visualization tools can be used include narrative (i.e., presenting specific aspects of the data to others, which is a form of storytelling), monitoring, and prediction (e.g., what-if analysis). Visual EDA tools must support the following features especially well:},

For example, user studies will require the display of representative and uncon-founded visual stimuli, while algorithms will need functional coverage and assessable benchmarks. However, data is often collected in a semi-automatic fashion or entirely hand-picked, which obscures the view of generality, impairs availability, and potentially violates privacy. There are some sub-domains of visualization that use synthetic data in the sense of genera-tive data models, whereas others work with real-world-based data sets and simulations. Depending on the visualization domain, many generative data models are " side projects " as part of an ad-hoc validation of a techniques paper and thus neither reusable nor general-purpose. We review existing work on popular data collections and generative data models in visualization to discuss the opportunities and consequences for technique validation, evaluation, and experiment design. We distill handling and future directions, and discuss how we can engineer generative data models and how visualization research could benefit from more and better use of generative data models.},

abstract = {ÐVisualization techniques are of increasing importance in exploring and analyzing large amounts of multidimensional information. One important class of visualization techniques which is particularly interesting for visualizing very large multidimensional data sets is the class of the pixel-oriented techniques. The basic idea of pixel-oriented visualization techniques is to represent as many data objects as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are of high importance in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal basis of pixel-oriented visualization techniques and show that the design decisions in developing them can be seen as solutions of well-defined optimization problems. This is true for the mapping of the data values to colors, the arrangement of pixels inside the subwindows, the shape of the subwindows, and the ordering of the dimension subwindows. The paper also discusses the design issues of special variants of pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing large spatial data sets. The optimization functions for the mentioned design decisions are important for the effectiveness of the resulting visualizations. We show this by evaluating the optimization functions and comparing it the results to the visualization obtained in a number of different application.},

abstract = {Visual analytics (VA) system development started in academic re-search institutions where novel visualization techniques and open source toolkits were developed. Simultaneously, small software companies, sometimes spin-offs from academic research institu-tions, built solutions for specific application domains. In recent years we observed the following trend: some small VA companies grew exponentially; at the same time some big software vendors such as IBM and SAP started to acquire successful VA compa-nies and integrated the acquired VA components into their existing frameworks. Generally the application domains of VA systems have broadened substantially. This phenomenon is driven by the genera-tion of more and more data of high volume and complexity, which leads to an increasing demand for VA solutions from many applica-tion domains. In this paper we survey a selection of state-of-the-art commercial VA frameworks, complementary to an existing survey on open source VA tools. From the survey results we identify sev-eral improvement opportunities as future research directions.},

In this article, we describe and evaluate a new visualization-based approach to mining large databases. The basic idea of our visual data mining techniques is to represent as many data items as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. The major goal of this article is to evaluate our visual data mining techniques and to compare them to other well-known visualization techniques for multidimensional data: the parallel coordinate and stick-figure visualization techniques. For the evaluation of visual data mining techniques, the perception of data properties counts most, while the CPU time and the number of secondary storage accesses are only of secondary importance. In addition to testing the visualization techniques using real data, we developed a testing environment for database visualizations similar to the benchmark approach used for comparing the performance of database systems. The testing environment allows the generation of test data sets with predefined data characteristics which are important for comparing the perceptual abilities of visual data mining techniques},

We generate summaries in three steps: (a) selecting the most important trends and patterns to communicate; (b) mapping these patterns onto words and phrases; and (c) generating actual texts based on these words and phrases. In this paper we focus on the first step, (a), selecting the information to communicate, and describe how we perform this using modified versions of standard data analysis algorithms such as segmentation. The modifications arose out of empirical work with users and domain experts, and in fact can all be regarded as applications of the Gricean maxims of Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner, which describe how a cooperative speaker should behave in order to help a hearer correctly interpret a text. The Gricean maxims are perhaps a key element of adapting data analysis algorithms for effective communication of information to human users, and should be considered by other researchers interested in communicating data to human users.},

@article{Keim2005,
abstract = {During the last decade Visual Exploration and Visual Data Mining tech-niques have proven to be of high value in exploratory data analysis since they combine human visual perception and recognition capabilities with the enormous storage ca-pacity and the computational power of today's computer systems in order to detect patterns and trends in the data. But the ever increasing mass of information leads to new challenges on visualization techniques and concepts. Due to technological progress in computer power and storage capacity today's scientific and commercial applications are capable of generating, storing and processing massive amounts of data. Most exist-ing visualization metaphors and concepts do not scale well on such large data sets as interaction capabilities and visual representations suffer from the massive number of data points. To bridge this gap, Visual Analytics aim to incorporate more intelligent means than to just retrieve and display the data items to filter the relevant from the non-relevant data. In this context the paper introduces a new approach based on a Multiresolution paradigm to increase the scalability of existing Visual data exploration techniques. The basic idea is to provide relevance driven compact representations of the underlying data set that present the data at different granularities. In the visualization step the available display space is then distributed according to the data granularity, to emphasize relevant information. The paper aims at introducing a technical base of Multiresolution visualization and provides an application example that shows the usefulness of the proposed approach.},

Fortunately, data on networks is plentiful; by visualizing this data, it is possible to greatly improve our understanding.

We begin with three static network displays; two of these use geographical relationships, while the third is a matrix arrangement that gives equal emphasis to all network links. Static displays can be swamped with large amounts of data; hence we introduce direct-manipulation techniques that permit the graphs to continue to reveal relationships in the context of much more data. In effect, the static displays are parameterized so that interesting views may easily be discovered interactively. The software to carry out this network visualization is called SeeNet.},

abstract = {The problem of choosing colors for data visualization is expressed by this quote from information visualization guru Edward Tufte: " {\ldots}avoiding catastrophe becomes the first principle in bringing color to information: Above all, do no harm. " (Envisioning Information, Edward Tufte, Graphics Press, 1990) Color used well can enhance and clarify a presentation. Color used poorly will obscure, muddle and confuse. While there is a strong aesthetic component to color, using color well in information display is essentially about function: what information are trying to convey, and how (or whether) color can enhance it. The most important use of color in information presentation is to distinguish one element from another, a function Edward Tufte calls " to label. " In Figure 1, for example, the different colors in the scatter plot label different products. But the use of color as a label goes beyond the distinctive data colors, for color in this discussion includes black, white and shades of gray. Figure 1. Scatter plot showing marketing vs. profit for four different products. In Figure 1, color is also used to define the background, draw the grid and axes, and label the chart. All visible parts of a presentation must be some color, all of which must work together to be effective. An effective design presents information in an organized manner, making it easy for the viewer to understand the roles and the relationships between the elements. A good organizing principle is to define categories of information, grouped by function and ordered by Choosing Colors for Data Visualization Page 2 importance. An effective use of color will group related items and command attention in proportion to importance. And, all will be legible. For example, all of the contextual information (grid, axis, labels, borders) in Figure 1 are shades of gray, while the data is brightly colored, which makes the data the focus of attention. The data colors are chosen so that all seem equally important, and all are easily visible on the white background. The light gray grid and axes lines are legible, but similar enough to the background white that they don't visually interfere with the overlaid data points. The gray borders are dark enough to frame the plotting area, but light enough that the black text can be easily read. Given an organized set of data elements, and a clear understanding of their function and importance, how does one go about choosing an effective set of colors? To answer this question, we will first look at some basic principles of color design, then the problem of legibility, and conclude with some guidelines for picking colors based on these principles.},

abstract = {This research demonstrates how principles of self-organization and behavior simulation can be used to represent dynamic data evolutions by extending the concept of information flocking, originally introduced by Proctor {\&} Winter [1], to time-varying datasets. A rule-based behavior system continuously controls and updates the dynamic actions of individual, three-dimensional elements that represent the changing data values of reoccurring data objects. As a result, different distinguishable motion types emerge that are driven by local interactions between the spatial elements as well as the evolution of time-varying data values. Notably, this representation technique focuses on the representation of dynamic data alteration characteristics, or how reoccurring data objects change over time, instead of depicting the exact data values themselves. In addition, it demonstrates the potential of motion as a useful information visualization cue. The original information flocking approach is extended to incorporate time-varying datasets, live database querying, continuous data streaming, real-time data similarity evaluation, automatic shape generation and more stable flocking algorithms. Different experiments prove that information flocking is capable of representing short-term events as well as long-term temporal data evolutions of both individual and groups of time-dependent data objects. An historical stock market quote price dataset is used to demonstrate the algorithms and principles of time-varying information flocking.},

abstract = {We survey work on the different uses of graphical mapping and interaction techniques for visual data mining of large data sets represented as table data. Basic terminology related to data mining, data sets, and visualization is introduced. Previous work on information visualization is reviewed in light of different categorizations of techniques and systems. The role of interaction techniques is discussed, in addition to work addressing the question of selecting and evaluating visualization techniques. We review some representative work on the use of information visualization techniques in the context of mining data. This includes both visual data exploration and visually expressing the outcome of specific mining algorithms. We also review recent innovative approaches that attempt to integrate visualization into the DM/KDD process, using it to enhance user interaction and comprehension.},

abstract = {Business Intelligence aims to improve decision quality. Research on BI achieving this goal is inconclusive, yet BI is still one of the top priorities among CIOs and is an active IS research area. A better understanding of the relationship between human intelligence and BI capabilities may lead to more fruitful BI endeavors. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that links capabilities of Business Information Visualization, a key modern BI enabler, to non-verbal (visual) intelligence abilities, and suggests propositional guidelines of how BI could improve decision making by impacting these intelligence abilities. The paper demonstrates that there is strong research support to suggest such linkages. Better understanding of what human abilities are important for better decisions, and what specific BI capabilities are needed to support these abilities will help improve the design, deployment, and utilization of BI tools, and, hopefully ultimately, achieve more efficient and effective business decisions.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach for the visualiza- tion of time-series data based on spirals. Different to classi- cal bar charts and line graphs, the spiral is suited to visualize large data sets and supports much better the iden- tification of periodic structures in the data. Moreover, it sup- ports both the visualization of nominal and quantitative data based on a similar visualization metaphor. The extension of the spiral visualization to 3D gives access to concepts for zooming and focusing and linking in the data set. The spiral comes with additional tools to further enhance the identifi- cation of cycles},

abstract = {Models are artifacts used to better understand our world. In the context of mining data to create knowledge, the modeler is often faced with discovering and understanding relationships in data that have no apparent analog in the laws of physical science. Much of these data are increasingly abstract; not directly related to the physical, perceivable world. The use of sketches and diagrams as aids in problem solving and as a means of communication is as old as recorded history. Can visualization help us not only to discover the patterns and relationships in these data, but also to use newly discovered knowledge to build computational models? The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of the process of modeling and, based upon theories of cognition, show how visualization can assist in developing and assessing computational models for very large, high dimensional data sets.},

abstract = {In the development process of powertrain systems, 2D function ensembles frequently occur in the context of multi-run simulations. An analysis has many facets, including distributions of extracted features, comparisons between ensemble members and target functions, and details-on-demand. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of an interactive approach for a comparative visual analysis of 2D function ensembles. The design focuses on a tight integration of domain-oriented and member-oriented visualization techniques, and it seeks to preserve the mental model of 2D functions on multiple levels of detail. In this context, we propose a novel focus+context approach for visualizations relying on data-driven placement which is based on labeling. We also extend work on feature-preserving downsampling of 2D functions. Our design supports a comparison of 2D functions based on juxtaposition, overlay, and explicit differences. It also enables an analysis in terms of extracted scalar features and 1D aggregations. An evaluation illustrates a workflow in our application context. User feedback indicates a time saving of 70{\%} for common tasks and a qualitative gain for the entire development process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = { Existing system level taxonomies of visualization tasks are geared more towards the design of particular representations than the facilitation of user analytic activity. We present a set of ten low level analysis tasks that largely capture people's activities while employing information visualization tools for understanding data. To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems. Further, the tasks may provide a form of checklist for system designers.},
