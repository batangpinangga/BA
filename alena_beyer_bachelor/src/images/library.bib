abstract = {Serial periodic data exhibit both serial and periodic properties. For example, time continues forward serially, but weeks, months, and years are periods that recur. While there are extensive visualization techniques for exploring serial data, and a few for exploring periodic data, no existing technique simultaneously displays serial and periodic attributes of a data set. We introduce a spiral visualization technique, which displays data along a spiral to highlight serial attributes along the spiral axis and periodic ones along the radii. We show several applications of the spiral visualization to data exploration tasks, present our implementation, discuss the capacity for data analysis, and present findings of our informal study with users in data-rich scientific domains.},

The core of our view on Visual Analytics is the new enabling and accessible analytic reasoning interactions supported by the combination of automated and visual analysis. In this paper, we outline the scope of Visual Analytics using two problem and three methodological classes in order to work out the need for and purpose of Visual Analytics. Thereby, the respective advantages and disadvantages of automated and visual analysis methods are explained plus examples of analytic reasoning interaction leading to a glimpse into the future of how Visual Analytics methods will enable us to go beyond what is possible when separately using the two methods.},

Its major strength is that patterns of multivariate data involving more than two attribute dimensions can often be more readily perceived in the context of a spatial relationship, whereas many techniques for spatial data such as direct volume rendering find difficult to depict with multivariate or multi-field data, and many techniques for non-spatial data such as parallel coordinates are less able to convey spatial relationships encoded in the data. This report fills several major gaps in the literature, drawing the link between the fundamental concepts in semiotics and the broad spectrum of glyph-based visualiza-tion, reviewing existing design guidelines and implementation techniques, and surveying the use of glyph-based visualization in many applications.},

abstract = {In the development process of powertrain systems, 2D function ensembles frequently occur in the context of multi-run simulations. An analysis has many facets, including distributions of extracted features, comparisons between ensemble members and target functions, and details-on-demand. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of an interactive approach for a comparative visual analysis of 2D function ensembles. The design focuses on a tight integration of domain-oriented and member-oriented visualization techniques, and it seeks to preserve the mental model of 2D functions on multiple levels of detail. In this context, we propose a novel focus+context approach for visualizations relying on data-driven placement which is based on labeling. We also extend work on feature-preserving downsampling of 2D functions. Our design supports a comparison of 2D functions based on juxtaposition, overlay, and explicit differences. It also enables an analysis in terms of extracted scalar features and 1D aggregations. An evaluation illustrates a workflow in our application context. User feedback indicates a time saving of 70{\%} for common tasks and a qualitative gain for the entire development process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this paper, we focus on the unique role of the parameter time in the context of visually driven data analysis. We will discuss three major aspects—visualization, analysis, and the user. It will be illustrated that it is necessary to consider the characteristics of time when generating visual representations. For that purpose, we take a look at different types of time and present visual examples. Integrating visual and analytical methods has become an increasingly important issue. Therefore, we present our experiences in temporal data abstraction, principal component analysis, and clustering of larger volumes of time-oriented data. The third main aspect we discuss is supporting user-centered visual analysis. We describe event-based visualization as a promising means to adapt the visualization pipeline to needs and tasks of users.},

Research on BI achieving this goal is inconclusive, yet BI is still one of the top priorities among CIOs and is an active IS research area. A better understanding of the relationship between human intelligence and BI capabilities may lead to more fruitful BI endeavors. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that links capabilities of Business Information Visualization, a key modern BI enabler, to non-verbal (visual) intelligence abilities, and suggests propositional guidelines of how BI could improve decision making by impacting these intelligence abilities. The paper demonstrates that there is strong research support to suggest such linkages. Better understanding of what human abilities are important for better decisions, and what specific BI capabilities are needed to support these abilities will help improve the design, deployment, and utilization of BI tools, and, hopefully ultimately, achieve more efficient and effective business decisions.},

abstract = {Visual data mining techniques have proven to be of high value in exploratory data analysis, and they also have a high potential for mining large databases. In this article, we describe and evaluate a new visualization-based approach to mining large databases. The basic idea of our visual data mining techniques is to represent as many data items as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. The major goal of this article is to evaluate our visual data mining techniques and to compare them to other well-known visualization techniques for multidimensional data: the parallel coordinate and stick-figure visualization techniques. For the evaluation of visual data mining techniques, the perception of data properties counts most, while the CPU time and the number of secondary storage accesses are only of secondary importance. In addition to testing the visualization techniques using real data, we developed a testing environment for database visualizations similar to the benchmark approach used for comparing the performance of database systems. The testing environment allows the generation of test data sets with predefined data characteristics which are important for comparing the perceptual abilities of visual data mining techniques},

abstract = {An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called 'recursive pattern' which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data-and application-dependent parameters, the user may largely influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only lim-ited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the ba-sic idea of the 'recursive pattern' technique, we provide sev-eral examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our 'recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimen-sion (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.},

abstract = {The problem of choosing colors for data visualization is expressed by this quote from information visualization guru Edward Tufte: " {\ldots}avoiding catastrophe becomes the first principle in bringing color to information: Above all, do no harm. " (Envisioning Information, Edward Tufte, Graphics Press, 1990) Color used well can enhance and clarify a presentation. Color used poorly will obscure, muddle and confuse. While there is a strong aesthetic component to color, using color well in information display is essentially about function: what information are trying to convey, and how (or whether) color can enhance it. The most important use of color in information presentation is to distinguish one element from another, a function Edward Tufte calls " to label. " In Figure 1, for example, the different colors in the scatter plot label different products. But the use of color as a label goes beyond the distinctive data colors, for color in this discussion includes black, white and shades of gray. Figure 1. Scatter plot showing marketing vs. profit for four different products. In Figure 1, color is also used to define the background, draw the grid and axes, and label the chart. All visible parts of a presentation must be some color, all of which must work together to be effective. An effective design presents information in an organized manner, making it easy for the viewer to understand the roles and the relationships between the elements. A good organizing principle is to define categories of information, grouped by function and ordered by Choosing Colors for Data Visualization Page 2 importance. An effective use of color will group related items and command attention in proportion to importance. And, all will be legible. For example, all of the contextual information (grid, axis, labels, borders) in Figure 1 are shades of gray, while the data is brightly colored, which makes the data the focus of attention. The data colors are chosen so that all seem equally important, and all are easily visible on the white background. The light gray grid and axes lines are legible, but similar enough to the background white that they don't visually interfere with the overlaid data points. The gray borders are dark enough to frame the plotting area, but light enough that the black text can be easily read. Given an organized set of data elements, and a clear understanding of their function and importance, how does one go about choosing an effective set of colors? To answer this question, we will first look at some basic principles of color design, then the problem of legibility, and conclude with some guidelines for picking colors based on these principles.},

abstract = {ÐVisualization techniques are of increasing importance in exploring and analyzing large amounts of multidimensional information. One important class of visualization techniques which is particularly interesting for visualizing very large multidimensional data sets is the class of the pixel-oriented techniques. The basic idea of pixel-oriented visualization techniques is to represent as many data objects as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. A number of different pixel-oriented visualization techniques have been proposed in recent years and it has been shown that the techniques are useful for visual data exploration in a number of different application contexts. In this paper, we discuss a number of issues which are of high importance in developing pixel-oriented visualization techniques. The major goal of this article is to provide a formal basis of pixel-oriented visualization techniques and show that the design decisions in developing them can be seen as solutions of well-defined optimization problems. This is true for the mapping of the data values to colors, the arrangement of pixels inside the subwindows, the shape of the subwindows, and the ordering of the dimension subwindows. The paper also discusses the design issues of special variants of pixel-oriented techniques for visualizing large spatial data sets. The optimization functions for the mentioned design decisions are important for the effectiveness of the resulting visualizations. We show this by evaluating the optimization functions and comparing it the results to the visualization obtained in a number of different application.},

Fortunately, data on networks is plentiful; by visualizing this data, it is possible to greatly improve our understanding. Our focus is on visualizing the data associated with a network and not on simply visualizing the structure of the network itself. We begin with three static network displays; two of these use geographical relationships, while the third is a matrix arrangement that gives equal emphasis to all network links. Static displays can be swamped with large amounts of data; hence we introduce direct-manipulation techniques that permit the graphs to continue to reveal relationships in the context of much more data. In effect, the static displays are parameterized so that interesting views may easily be discovered interactively. The software to carry out this network visualization is called SeeNet.},

For example, user studies will require the display of representative and uncon-founded visual stimuli, while algorithms will need functional coverage and assessable benchmarks. However, data is often collected in a semi-automatic fashion or entirely hand-picked, which obscures the view of generality, impairs availability, and potentially violates privacy. There are some sub-domains of visualization that use synthetic data in the sense of genera-tive data models, whereas others work with real-world-based data sets and simulations. Depending on the visualization domain, many generative data models are " side projects " as part of an ad-hoc validation of a techniques paper and thus neither reusable nor general-purpose. We review existing work on popular data collections and generative data models in visualization to discuss the opportunities and consequences for technique validation, evaluation, and experiment design. We distill handling and future directions, and discuss how we can engineer generative data models and how visualization research could benefit from more and better use of generative data models.},

While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data vol-umes increases at much lower pace.

Further-more, it is the combination of related research areas includ-ing visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns vi-sual analytics into a promising field of research.

abstract = {Visual analytics (VA) system development started in academic re-search institutions where novel visualization techniques and open source toolkits were developed. Simultaneously, small software companies, sometimes spin-offs from academic research institu-tions, built solutions for specific application domains. In recent years we observed the following trend: some small VA companies grew exponentially; at the same time some big software vendors such as IBM and SAP started to acquire successful VA compa-nies and integrated the acquired VA components into their existing frameworks. Generally the application domains of VA systems have broadened substantially. This phenomenon is driven by the genera-tion of more and more data of high volume and complexity, which leads to an increasing demand for VA solutions from many applica-tion domains. In this paper we survey a selection of state-of-the-art commercial VA frameworks, complementary to an existing survey on open source VA tools. From the survey results we identify sev-eral improvement opportunities as future research directions.},

However, excitement is building around dynamic queries sliders and other graphical selectors for query specification, with results displayed by information visualization techniques. These filtering techniques have proven to be effective for many tasks in which visual presentations enable discovery of relationships, clusters, outliers, gaps, and other patterns. Scaling visual presentations from millions to billions of records will require collaborative research efforts in information visualization and database management to enable rapid aggregation, meaningful coordinated windows, and effective summary graphics. This paper describes current and proposed solutions (atomic, aggregated, and density plots) that facilitate sense-making for interactive visual exploration of billion record data sets.},

Specifically, we adopt a user-centric app- roach in which we take user perception into consideration.

Our user-centric task categorization can be used to effectively guide the organization of multidimensional data projection layouts. Moreover, we present real- world examples that demonstrate effective choices made by visualiza- tion designers faced with complex datasets requiring dimensionality reduction.},

abstract = { Existing system level taxonomies of visualization tasks are geared more towards the design of particular representations than the facilitation of user analytic activity. We present a set of ten low level analysis tasks that largely capture people's activities while employing information visualization tools for understanding data. To help develop these tasks, we collected nearly 200 sample questions from students about how they would analyze five particular data sets from different domains. The questions, while not being totally comprehensive, illustrated the sheer variety of analytic questions typically posed by users when employing information visualization systems. We hope that the presented set of tasks is useful for information visualization system designers as a kind of common substrate to discuss the relative analytic capabilities of the systems. Further, the tasks may provide a form of checklist for system designers.},

@article{Keim1995a,
abstract = {An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called a `recursive pattern', which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may greatly influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the `recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our `recursive pattern' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application},

abstract = {Visualization can provide valuable assistance for data analysis and decision making tasks. However, how people perceive and interact with a visualization tool can strongly influence their understanding of the data as well as the system's usefulness. Human factors therefore contribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an important role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools. Several research initiatives have begun to explore human factors in visualization, particularly in perception-based design. Nonetheless, visualization work involving human factors is in its infancy, and many potentially promising areas have yet to be explored. Therefore, this paper aims to 1) review known methodology for doing human factors research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors research in visualization to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future research.},
