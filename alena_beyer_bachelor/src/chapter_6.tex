Throughout this work we identified limitations of this work and remaining challenges for future work which are represented in this chapter. 

\section{Limitations} \label{limitations}
In Chapter 3 we classified the visualization techniques according to their scalability. Therefore, we made assumptions such as the number of data rows and number of attributes \textit{based on the original paper} when they got published. We did not consider any updates and extensions of the respecting visualization technique. To give an example, the scalability of \textit{TimeWheel} was set on the 2D-TimeWheel although an extended 3D-Version exists. We decided to consider the visualization techniques mentioned in\cite{Aigner2011} as they are recommended for time-oriented data but extensions may have a better scalability.  
Moreover, we took the classification of Aigner et al.\cite{Aigner2011} regarding univariate and multivariate. If the judgement was wrong, our findings are also affected.
In Chapter 4 the success criteria score is based on the assumption that wrinting in a tool specific language is more difficult for a business user than writing in a known language such as Java, JavaScript or R. This assumption does not assume that a tool specific language might support the user better than only writing in a known language. This limitation has to be considered in the interpretation of our results.



For Future Work Tableau, QS and Power BI should implement the missing techniques such as distortion techniques and advanced navigation techniques. 
\section{Future Research}
\textbf{Univariate Data}\\
This work tried to contribute in the visualization of large multivariate time-oriented data. As we excluded univariate data visualization techniques for univariate time-series data were not studied. However, time-series are an important subject of interest in business.\\
\textbf{Evaluation in business}
The techniques considered in this work were all techniques for ADV. Yet, business user are unfamiliar with advanced visualization techniques. 
As business users should not be distracted by complex visualization systems \cite{Tegarden1999} evaluating the business applicability of the proposed visualization techniques would be an important future work.
