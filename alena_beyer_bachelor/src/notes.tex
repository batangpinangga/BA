\section{Problems}
The term business intelligence contains very different areas of business: E-commerce, Smart Health, E-Government, Science & Technology, Security&Public safety. Each sector collects different types of data and uses different applications, which makes it difficult to write a work which is equally relevant to each sector. \cite{ChenH.ChiangR.Sorey2012}
But with data abstraction as defined in \cite{Aigner2007} various applications with different data can be visualized.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}
In summary, currently there exists no all-in-one solution for the analysis of large time-oriented data in business. While the framework d3.js can implement any possible feature of large data visualization the business user needs to have programming knowledge. However, this conflicts with an self-service visualization tool. When business decide to use tools such as Tableau, QS and Power BI they need to be aware about the limitations in displaying large time-oriented  data in an effective manner. 
\par
Currently, tools rarely support important techniques such as Pattern Search or multi-resolution metaphors. For displaying large data sets these features are necessary to provide the overview + detail view. In summary, the missing features remain future work.
