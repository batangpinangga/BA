\section{Problems}
The term business intelligence contains very different areas of business: E-commerce, Smart Health, E-Government, Science & Technology, Security&Public safety. Each sector collects different types of data and uses different applications, which makes it difficult to write a work which is equally relevant to each sector. \cite{ChenH.ChiangR.Sorey2012}
But with data abstraction as defined in \cite{Aigner2007} various applications with different data can be visualized.
