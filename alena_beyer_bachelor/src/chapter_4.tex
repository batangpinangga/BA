\section{Scalability in visualization tools}
Besides of the visualization technique itself the visualization tool influences the visual scalability in limiting how many datarows can be fetched in each visualization. Qlik Sense limits the initial fetch to 10.000 but gives the opportunity to fetch more data if needed. 
%Definition which tool meant: Tools can be divided into BI Tools, Analytic Tools, Visualization Tools and Custom Tools\cite{Schnell2014}.
%Difference Data Minining and Visual Analytics: First generate new knowledge and then visualiza vs. visualize and generate new knowledge

\section{Selection of Tools}
\textbf{Requirements}
Advanced Data Visualization in business context requires software that is able to scale visualization in an "effective manner"\cite{Russom2011}. Offering advanced visualization techniques, parameterization, interaction and analytical methods such as data abstraction\cite{Tegarden1999,Aigner2011,Eick2002,Zhanga} are core functions of ADV software. Based on the Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence and Analytics Platforms\cite{Parenteau2016} Qlik, Tableau and Microsoft are the leading visionaries of BI Vendors. \cite{ITCentralStation} as a crowdsourcing recommendation platform for BI tools ranked Tableau, Qlik, Oracle, Microsoft Power BI and IBM Cognos on the first five places.
\textbf{The Role of APIs}
Commercial software tends to need more time for the development and integration of advanced visualization for large data\cite{Zhanga, Simon2014}. To bridge the gap, vendors started to offer a bunch of APIs to create and integrate visualizations.

\textbf{Software not included in this work}
As the goal of this work is to compare software tools %alternative: provide a market overview
for Visual Analytics in business and time-oriented data we focus on Business Intelligence and Analytics software. Furthermore, the software needs visualization features, the ability to present time-dependent data. Software with one of the following items is intentionally not considered: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Software that only presents one-dimensional data. 
    \item Software that \todo{write reasons why Tools are not considered}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Investigation of Advanced Visualization Tools using a Feature Classification Scheme}
In this section we analyze advanced visualization tools in business with a feature classification scheme. We provide the classification scheme based on the collected success criteria of chapter 3 and apply it to current business intelligence and analytics tools offering visualization. Even though the selection of the tools is not exhaustive, we believe that the reviewed products represent the state-of-the art.
